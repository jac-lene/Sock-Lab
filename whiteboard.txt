BACKEND PLAN

What are my MVP goals?
    - an image of a sock that can be clicked and change color
    - a pattern that changes based on the user input
    - a visual library that stores all of my saved designs

What are my stretch goals? 
    - Mark pattern as complete, in progress, upload photos of finished sock
    - user auth
    - yarn store map
    - more than one type of garment/pattern

How to accomplish each part: 

Sock Image
    - alter model to work best for use
    - allow editable information from the SAVE button ie name
    DONE
        - need to establish model
        - need to establish form  
        - figure out link to frontend 

Create Route
    - "Visible" form element for user info
    - Write pattern with form inputs/default values
    - Figure out how to save image/generate image
    - When saving allow user to input name, default value

Show Route 
    - Pattern library with saved images
        - Show name and Image
    - Detail page with pattern and visual information
        - all info and display pattern

Update Route
    - Opens up from detail page
    - User is taken to the generate page and able to change style/color etc
    - new pattern is saved

Delete Route
    - In Detail Page user is able to delete.
    - Are you sure?
